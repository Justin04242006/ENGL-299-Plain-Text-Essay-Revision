  {"id":"anderssonCarbonTaxRegressivity2021","abstract":"A common presumption in economics is that a carbon tax is regressive – that the tax disproportionately burdens low-income households. However, this presumption originates from early research on carbon taxes that used US data, and little is known about the factors that determine the level of regressivity of carbon taxation across countries. In this policy...

  {"id":"douenneCanWeReconcile2019","abstract":"Using a new survey and National households’ survey data, we investigate French perception over carbon taxation. We ﬁnd that French people largely reject a tax and dividend policy where revenues of the tax would be redistributed uniformly. However, their perception about the properties of the tax are biased: people overestimate the negative impact on their purchasing power, wrongly think the scheme is regressive, and do not perceive it as environmentally eﬀective. Our econometric analysis shows that correcting these three bias would suﬃce to generate majority acceptance. Yet, we ﬁnd that people’s beliefs are persistent and their revisions biased towards pessimism, so that only few can be convinced.","author":[{"family":"Douenne","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Fabre","given":"Adrien"}],"citation-key":"douenneCanWeReconcile2019","container-title":"FAERE Working Paper","ISSN":"2274-5556","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Can We Reconcile French People with the Carbon Tax?

  {"id":"douenneFrenchAttitudesClimate2020","abstract":"This paper aims to assess the prospects for French climate policies after the Yellow Vests crisis halted the planned increase in the carbon tax. From a large representative survey, we elicit knowledge, perceptions and values over climate change, we examine opinions relative to carbon taxation, and we assess support for other climate policies. Specific attention is given to the link between perceptions of climate change and attitudes towards policies. The paper also studies in detail the determinants of attitudes in terms of political and socio-demographic variables. Among many results, we find limited knowledge but high concern for climate change. We also document a large rejection of the carbon tax but majority support for stricter norms and green investments, and reveal the rationales behind these preferences. Our study entails policy recommendations, such as an information campaign on climate change. Indeed, we find that climate awareness increases support for climate policies but no evidence for the formation of opinions through partisan cues as in the US, suggesting that better access to science could foster support for climate policies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Douenne","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Fabre","given":"Adrien"}],"citation-key":"douenneFrenchAttitudesClimate2020","container-title":"Ecological Economics","container-title-short":"Ecological Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106496","ISSN":"0921-8009","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,1]]},"page":"106496","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"French attitudes on climate change, carbon taxation and other climate policies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310705","volume":"169"},
